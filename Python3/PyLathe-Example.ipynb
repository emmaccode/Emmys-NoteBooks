    "# PyLathe\n",
    "This just in, PyLathe is out! PyLathe is an a Python Environment for Lathe. In the future, optimizations will be made, and we'll likely have to figure out if this Julia is running natively or not. The good news is that there is a similar package coming for R, and hopefully with it, magic commands might be flushed out. As for this version, right now in 0.1.0, we have a basic interface that allows us to use what's called a \" Classic Environment\" -- which is just a fancy way of saying that the environment loaded is the default Julia environment, not a virtual environment. In the future, there will be a very **easy** way to manage packages inside of these environments using the constructor's package manager. A lot of this code is an early template for what is to come. As it stands, the interface code could definitely see some optimizations."
